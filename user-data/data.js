    "Hi, I'm Xinrui Wu (Âê¥Ê¨£Èîê)!",

    "I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree(2023-2027) in Embedded Systems at the SISE, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)",
  
    "My research interests include embodied intelligence, multimodal systems, robot perception, and model lightweighting.",
    
    "I previously conducted research on open-vocabulary detection and segmentation at the UESTC Future Media Center, and later at Megvii Technology, I led the development of a large-scale open-vocabulary detection framework, building a data engine to establish a comprehensive visual perception and cognition system. During my visiting study at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, I proposed a distillation scheme to transfer knowledge from complex models to lightweight networks, which was applied to semantic segmentation of marine organisms. Since early 2025, I have been interning at the Tsinghua AIR Institute, exploring ways to enhance the controllability and efficiency of large model reasoning, and researching how to implement human-like thinking processes in embodied robots.",
  
    "These experiences have shaped my end-to-end research chain, spanning from 'perception' to 'reasoning'. My long-term goal is to contribute, even modestly, to enabling machines to understand and interact with the complex world as efficiently as humans do.",
